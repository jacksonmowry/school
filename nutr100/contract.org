I have reviewed the syllabus and INTRO lectures for NUTR 100 and I understand all course requirements and responsibilities. I also understand that late work is not accepted in this course for any reason that is not preapproved by my GTA or Professor Murphy. Please see below for the screenshots of my GRL login screen.
