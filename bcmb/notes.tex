\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons
\item we only care about outer electons
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Molecule vs Compound}
\label{sec:org2655de7}
\begin{itemize}
\item two or more atoms vs two or more different elements
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Types of bonding}
\label{sec:org82c99dd}
Covalent bonds: electrons are shared among atoms
\begin{itemize}
\item polar: unequal sharing
\item non polar: equal sharing
\item single and double covalent bonds
\begin{itemize}
\item depends on how many electrons are being shared
\end{itemize}
\item Polar examples
\begin{itemize}
\item Oxygen and hydrogen can form a covalent bond
\begin{itemize}
\item water is a polar substance
\end{itemize}
\item Sulfur and hydrogen can also
\item Same with N and H
\end{itemize}
\item Non polar examples
\begin{itemize}
\item C and H
\item C and C
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Ionic bonds: One or more electrons from one atom are removed and attached to another atom, forms cations and anions
\begin{itemize}
\item this will make both atoms ``happy'', or closer to a completed valence shell
\begin{itemize}
\item These can also be called salts
\end{itemize}
\item Examples
\begin{itemize}
\item Na Cl, Na has one, Cl has 7, they can combine and make each complete
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Hydrogen bonds: Weak bonds between hydrogen and other atoms
\begin{itemize}
\item Water is polar and it makes a ton of hydrogen bonds by orienting its O to another water molecules H (weak Hydrogen bond)
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
Chemical Atom & Symbol & Ion & Electrons Gained or Lost\\
\hline
Hydrogen & H & Hydrogen Ion & 1 Lost\\
Sodium & Na & Sodium Ion & 1 Lost\\
Potassium & K & Potassium Ion & 1 Lost\\
Chlorine & Cl & Chloride Ion & 1 Gained\\
Magnesium & Mg & Magnesium Ion & 2 Lost\\
Calcium & Ca & Calcium Ion & 2 Lost\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\subsubsection{Electronegativity}
\label{sec:orgdd0b462}
\begin{itemize}
\item when two atoms with differing electronegativity bond the electrons will concentrate more towards the atom with greater electronegativity (polar covalent bonding)
\begin{itemize}
\item if two atoms with the same electronegativity bond they will form a non polar bond
\item non polar bonds are hydrophobic

\item Tertiary: portions of the secondary structure further interact by forming covalent disulfide bonds and additional interaction. From this emerges a stable three-dimensional molecule. Dependong on the protein, this may be the final function state.

\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Take notes of 1-4 protein structures}
\label{sec:org6112d7c}
\subsubsection{Protein Conformation}
\label{sec:org093ae95}
\begin{itemize}
\item in nature proteins appear folded,  bended, or twisted forming more compact strctures
\item this is known as a proteins conformation
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Primary Structure}
\label{sec:org1e7804b}
\begin{itemize}
\item primary structure is determined by:
\begin{itemize}
\item the number of amino acids in the chain
\item the specific sequence of different amino acids
\end{itemize}
\item Kinda like a linear chain, just not an exact straight line
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Secondary Structure}
\label{sec:org8345e1e}
\begin{itemize}
\item Attraction between various regions along this linear chain form hydrogen bonds and thus create the secondary structure in a protein
\item These are called peptide bonds
\item these bonds occur at regular intervals and force the conformation into a spiral or alpha helix
\item in addition hydrogen bonds can also form between peptide bonds when extended regions of a polypeptide chain run parallel to each other, forming a relatively straight, extended region known as a beta pleated sheet
\item In between these two structures random coil conformations help to link the two together
\item these two structures give the protein its ability to anchor itself into a lipid bilayer
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Tertiary Protein Structure}
\label{sec:orgb8b6544}
\begin{itemize}
\item after secondary structures are formed additional amino acid side chains become possible
\item they fold the polypeptide into three-dimensional conformations,  forming a functional protein
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Determining Tertiary Structure
\label{sec:org74a4acc}
\begin{enumerate}
\item hydrogen bonds between side groups of amino acids or with surrounding water molecules
\item ionic interactions between ionized regions along the chain
\item interactions between nonpolar regions
\item covalent disulfide bonds linking the sulfur-containing side chains of two cysteine amino acids
\item van der Waals forces
\end{enumerate}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{/home/jackson/Pictures/fold.png}
\end{center}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Quaternary Protein Structure}
\label{sec:orgb3aec9a}
\begin{itemize}
\item if more than one polypeptide chain is bonded together it is known as a quaternary structure, or multimeric proteins
\item the same forces act upon these proteins as described above
\item therefore the subnits are held together in the same ways
\end{itemize}
