- atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons
- we only care about outer electons
*** Molecule vs Compound
- two or more atoms vs two or more different elements
*** Types of bonding
Covalent bonds: electrons are shared among atoms
- polar: unequal sharing
- non polar: equal sharing
- single and double covalent bonds
  - depends on how many electrons are being shared
- Polar examples
  - Oxygen and hydrogen can form a covalent bond
    - water is a polar substance
  - Sulfur and hydrogen can also
  - Same with N and H
- Non polar examples
  - C and H
  - C and C
Ionic bonds: One or more electrons from one atom are removed and attached to another atom, forms cations and anions
- this will make both atoms "happy", or closer to a completed valence shell
  - These can also be called salts
- Examples
  - Na Cl, Na has one, Cl has 7, they can combine and make each complete
Hydrogen bonds: Weak bonds between hydrogen and other atoms
- Water is polar and it makes a ton of hydrogen bonds by orienting its O to another water molecules H (weak Hydrogen bond)

*** Electronegativity
- when two atoms with differing electronegativity bond the electrons will concentrate more towards the atom with greater electronegativity (polar covalent bonding)
  - if two atoms with the same electronegativity bond they will form a non polar bond
  - non polar bonds are hydrophobic
  - polor bonds are hydrophilic
  - polar dissolves polar
*** Ionic Molecules
- Ionization
  - carboxyl group
    - (-COOH)
  - amino group
    - (-NH2)
*** Fucntion Groups
- Ionized Group
  - Carboxyl
  - Amino
  - Phosphate
** Free Radicals
- atoms of molecules containing a single electron
- Unstable, and highly reactive
** Solutions
- the liquid everything is disolved in is the solvent
- Everything else is the solute
- water is a universal solvent
- however not all molecules can be dissolved in water
*** rxn with water
- hydrolysis breaking of a chemical bond with the additions of elements of water -H and -OH to the products
- dehydration involves a removal of water, one net water molecules is removed to combine two small molecules into one larger one
** Osmosis
- water moving between fluid compartments
- water moves from areas of low concentrations of solutes, to areas of high solute concentration, essentially creating two equal areas of solute concentration
- rate of diffusion: 10 billion molecules per second
** Solubility in water
- polar molecules will easily dissolve in water: hydrophilic
- non polar molecules will not easily dissolve in water: hydrophobic
** Amphipathic Molecules
- a special class of molecules that have a polar or ionized region at one site and a nonpolar region at another site
- in water these molecules will form clusters with their polar regions at the surface of the cluster, and the non polar sites inwards
- these help dissolve non polar substances in the presense of water
- plasma membrane structure helps transport molecules in the blood
** Concentration
- the amount of solute present in a unit volume of solution
- moles/liter is an example
** Acids and Bases
- molecules that release H are called acids
- mocules that accept H are called bases
- Hydrogen is very useful in our bodys energy system due to the fact that it is very simple
- The bodies pH range is around 7.35 to 7.45
  - blood 7.4
** Terminology of different Sciences
- Organic is C-H
- Inorganic in non C
- Biochem is living organisms
** Classes of Organic Molecules
*** Carbohydrates
- Disaccharides and polyaccharides
*** Lipids
- Triglycerides
- Phospholipids
- Steroids
*** Proteins
- polypeptides
*** Nucleic Acids
- DNA and RNA
** Organic chemicals
- compounds containing carbon bonded to hydrogens
- carbon is the fundamental element of life
  - 4 atoms in valence
  - single, double, triple covalent bonds
  - linear, branched, or ringed molecules
** Fucntional Groups Continued
- smaller groups of atoms that bind to organic compound
- confer unique reactive properties on the whole molecules
- Hydroxyl (O-H), found in alcohols, and carbohydrates
- Carboxyl (COOH), found in fatty acids, proteins, and organic acids
- Ester (COOR), found in lipids
- Carbonyl (COH), found in aldehydes, polysaccharides
- Phosphate (PO4H2), found in DNA, RNA, ATP
- Methyl (CH3), found in DNA, amino Acids, Lipids, Carbohydrates
** Carbohydrates: Basic Structure
- General Formula (CH2O)
- Basic Structure:
  - Backbone of Carbon
  - Polyhydroxy aldehyde or ketone
- Common Configurations
  - Monosaccharide: polyhydeoxy aldehyde or ketone with 3-7 carbons
  - Disaccharide: two monosaccharides
  - Polysaccharide: five or more monosaccharides
- Changing the chiral orientation of just one C will change the molecule
- Different arrangements will create different structual properties:
  - linear: celluose, structural integriety
  - branched: starch, glycogen, storing energy, easy to pull apart and access
    - you can pull whole branches off of the structure for easy energy access
- Combining two different monosaccharides will form a new carbohydrate
  - table sugar
** How the body uses sugar
- glycogen exists in the body as a resevoir of available energy that is stored in the chemical bonds within individual glucose monomers
- blood sugar
** Lipids
- moleucles composed of mostly hydrogen and carbon
- linked by non polar covalent bonds, they are nonpolar, low solubility in water
  - fatty acids, triglycerides, phospholipids, steroids
  - act as a boundry
- valuable store of energy
- major component of all cellular membranes
- important signaling molecules
*** Fatty acids
- hydrocarbon chain, and a carboxyl group
- all single bonds: saturated fatty acid
- one or more double bonds: unsaturated fatty acids
- >1: polyunsaturated
- 1: monounsaturated
*** Triglycerides
- the majority of the lipides in the body
- glycerol, a three-carbon sugar-alcohol, bonded to three fatty acids
- present in blood and cn be synthesized in the liver
- stored in great quantities in adipose tissue
- energy reserve or the body, during fasting or exercise
*** Phospholipids
- similar in overall sructure to triglycerides, but the third hydroxyl group of glycerol is linked to phosphate
- a small polar (ionized nitrogen-containing molecule) is usually attached to the phosphate
- polar region at one end, two fatty acids make a non-polar region at the opposite end
- they are amphipathic
  - they form lipid bilayers of cellular membranes
*** Steroids
- a distinctly different structure from those of the other subclasses of lipid molecules.
- four interconnected rings of carbon atoms form the skeleton of every steroid
- no water-soluble
- cholesterol, cortisol, estrogen, testosterone
- cholesterol is inserted into the phospholipid bilayer
  - reinforcing the membrane
*** Proteins
- about 50 percent of the organic material in the body (17 percent by weight)
- carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and small amounts of sulfur
- they are macromolecules, thousands of atoms
- 20 amino acids
- polymer: peptide, polypeptide, protein
[[/home/jackson/Pictures/Screenshot_2022-01-27_09-06-18.png]]
- amino acids are attached through peptides bonds to from proteins
- proteins fold into very specific 3D shapes
- functions: support, enzymes, transport, defense, movement
  - Primary: a series of amino acids bound in a chain. amine acids display small charges functional groups
  - Secondary: develops CO- and NH- groups on adjacent amino acids form hydrogen bonds. This action folds the chain into local configurations called the alpha helic and the beta pleated sheet. Most proteins have both types of secondary structures
  - Tertiary: portions of the secondary structure further interact by forming covalent disulfide bonds and additional interaction. From this emerges a stable three-dimensional molecule. Dependong on the protein, this may be the final function state.
  - Quaternary: Exists only in proteins that consist of more than one polypeptide chain.
- Two variables detrmine the primary structure of a protein
  - the number of amino acids in the chain
  - the specific sequence of different amino acids

** DONE Take notes of 1-4 protein structures
***  Protein Conformation
- in nature proteins appear folded,  bended, or twisted forming more compact strctures
- this is known as a proteins conformation
*** Primary Structure
- primary structure is determined by:
  - the number of amino acids in the chain
  - the specific sequence of different amino acids
- Kinda like a linear chain, just not an exact straight line
*** Secondary Structure
- Attraction between various regions along this linear chain form hydrogen bonds and thus create the secondary structure in a protein
- These are called peptide bonds
- these bonds occur at regular intervals and force the conformation into a spiral or alpha helix
- in addition hydrogen bonds can also form between peptide bonds when extended regions of a polypeptide chain run parallel to each other, forming a relatively straight, extended region known as a beta pleated sheet
- In between these two structures random coil conformations help to link the two together
- these two structures give the protein its ability to anchor itself into a lipid bilayer
*** Tertiary Protein Structure
- after secondary structures are formed additional amino acid side chains become possible
- they fold the polypeptide into three-dimensional conformations,  forming a functional protein
**** Determining Tertiary Structure
1. hydrogen bonds between side groups of amino acids or with surrounding water molecules
2. ionic interactions between ionized regions along the chain
3. interactions between nonpolar regions
4. covalent disulfide bonds linking the sulfur-containing side chains of two cysteine amino acids
5. van der Waals forces
[[/home/jackson/Pictures/fold.png]]
*** Quaternary Protein Structure
- if more than one polypeptide chain is bonded together it is known as a quaternary structure, or multimeric proteins
- the same forces act upon these proteins as described above
- therefore the subnits are held together in the same ways

** Nucleic Acids
Consists of DNA and RNA. Nucleotide monomer.
DNA - deoxyribonucleic acid,  A, T, C, G, double helix, hereditary material
RNA - ribonucleic acid, A, U, C, G, organizes protein synthesis, ribose sugar
Nucleotides are composed of, a phosophate, a pnetose sugar, and a
nintrogenous base (A, T, C, G, or U)
Hydrogen bonds hold DNA together, meaning it is a great way to store information. The 650 million hydrogen bonds in chromosome 1 give it its very strong structure, great for storing information. The half life of DNA can be thousands of years. mRNA has a half life of 30 seconds to 6 hours. This short lived RNA gets the information from DNA to be used somewhere else.
DNA and RNA are negatively charged. A and T will always be together, C and G will always be together, therfore A=T, and C=G. There will always be three rings in the center of the double helix, so one side (A) will have 2 rings, and the other side (T) will have one ring. The number of bonds between A and T will make 2 hydrogen bonds, C and G will form 3. G and C bonds are stronger than the A and T pairing. The reason why hydrogens bonds are better than covalent bonds is because they are weaking, making it much easier to break.
When beginning DNA transcription it is necessary to start in an area with lots of A and T because those bonds are easier to break apart. We use these "markers" to show where to start. Humans have plenty of AT regions.
A pyrimidine and purine combine to give you the three ring structure in the center of the double helix. How DNA is read and replicated is directional. 5' to 3', one strand will be one direction the other will be the other direction, the *anti-parallel* configuration. Both ends will need to be started on opposite ends.
RNA is only a single chain, meaning it can hydrogen bond with itself. Ribose sugar rather than deoxyribose. The pyrimidine base thymine in DNA is replaced by uracil in RNA
** ATP: The Energy Molecule of Cells
Adenosine triphosphate, adenine, ribose, three phosphate.
Function to transfer and storage of energy.
High energy covalent bonds hold the three phosphates together. Three ADHD kids together on one seat in the bus. Kicking out one phosphate releases a ton of energy, puttong that energy into the cell and creating ADP. The bond between phosphate 1-2 is 8 times less energetic than the bond between 2-3. Lots of ATP vs ADP means a high energy state in the cell.

** Typical Sizes of Cell Structures
Cells are 10 micrometers, cells are small but they are 10-100 times larger than primative cells. We can fit a lot in the cells but they must be organized very well in order to remain functioning. Things are very compartmentalized within cells, in order to allow different chemistry on the inside and outside of memebranes.
** Comparison of Cytoplasm and Cytosol
Cytoplasm: the parts in between the plasma membrane and the nucleus of the cell.
Cytosol: the liquid everything is disolved in, leaving no free space anywhere in the molecule.
** Membranes
The major structural part of the cell. Regulates passage of substances in and out, and between organells and cytosol. Detects chemical messengers at cell surface. Links adjacent cells together by memebrance junctions. Anchors cells to the extracellular matrix.
Some substances see a brick wall, others see a gate. These substances need some form of carrier (usually a protein) to get it. The membrane is a good place for substances to meet up and then to interact.
*** Structure
*Phospholipids* (amphipathic)
Non-polar: 2 fatty acids, tail
Polar: Phosphate head
*Cholesterol*
4 non-polar rings
Interacts strongly with phospholipid fatty acids
We need these two to act somewhere in between a liquid and a solid, creating a dynamic structure for input and output.
This membrane has additional components in order to maintain fluidity.
**** Membrane Proteins
*Integral membrane proteins*: embedded within bilayer, can not be extracted without membrane dusruption, amphipathic, usually reffered to as transmembrane proteins.
*Peripheral membrane proteins*: not amphopathic, located only on membrane surface.
Both are needed in order to have a proper functioning membrane. 1/4 to 1/3 of DNA is for membrane proteins.
These membrane proteins are embedded within or just on the surface.
7tm crosses the bilayer 7 times. Has componenets on both the inside and the outside, allowing a message to bo transmitted seemlessly.
*** Membrance Fluidity
To many unsaturated fatty acids, will be to liquid due to not enough interactions. Leading to leaking cells. To much saturated fatty acids (to much interaction) will not allow anything in or out,  making a solid layer.
Phosopholipids swap approx 10^7 times per second, or move side to side. Introducing cholsterol halps maintain this fluidity.
*** Membrane Junctions
Allow adjacent cells tophysically contact along part of their membrances securely.
*Intergrins*: transmembrane proteins that bind to specific protiens in the extracellular matrix, and link them to membrane proteins on adjacent cells
*Junctions*: desmosomes, tight junctions, gap junctions.
**** Desmosomes
A region between two adjacent cells where adjacent plas, a membranes are seperated by 20 nanometers, dense plaques along the cytoplasmic surface on the plasma membrane. They serve as anchoring points for cadherins, which are proteins that extend from the cell in to the extracellular space, they then link up and bind with cadherins from an adjacent cell. They hold adjacent cells firmly together in areas that are subject to stretching, skin.
**** Tight Junctions
When the extracellular surfaces of two adjacent plasma membranes join, so no space remains between. Occurs in a band around the entire cell. limit movement of material between cells. Gut and bladder.
**** Gap Junctions
Protein channels linking cytosols of 2 cells. Connexins form a small protein-lined channel. Allows small molecules like ions, not allowing larger proteins
** Nucleus
Storage and transmission of genetic information to the next generation of cells
This stored information is usd to synthesize proteins.
Chromatin- DNa in association with protiens forming a fine netwoek of threads
During cell division, chromatin threads become tightly condensed, forming rod-like bodies known as chromosomes.
Surrounding the nucleus is a barrier known as a nuclear envelope, composed 2 mebranes. The membranes are joined together forming nuclear pores, small circular openings. RNA and proteins move thorugh these pores.
Nucleolus: densely staining filamentous region without a membrane prominent in the nucleus. This is the site of ribosome subnit assembly. Otherwise known where ribosomes are made, rRNA and proteins are combines. DNA is coverted to RNA which then folds in on itself.
** Ribosomes
Where proteins are created within a cell, comprised of protein and made using RNA instructions. On ribosomes protein molecules are made from amino acids, using genetic information from mRNA from the DNA in the nucleus.
Small subunit is called 30S, a unit of time 10^-13 seconds. Time it takes for a subunit to reach a no movement in a centrifuge.
50S is the large subunit,
Full ribosome is 80s, within the cytoplasm and attached to somethig in the cell.
2 kinds of ribosomes, free, bound. Free are in cytoplasm making protien. Bound are bound to the ER making a special protein.
** Endoplasmic Reticulum
Rough ER: ribosomes bound to its cytosolic surface, taking RNA and making amino acids language. Proteins go to the golgi apparatus, they must be bound up otherwise they will be off into the cytoplasm.
Smooth ER: no ribosomal particals on its surface, lipids are made, also detocification of hydrophobic molecules. Stores and releases Ca2+ which controls various cells activities such as muscle contraction.
Make more phospholipids, turns cholesterol into other steroids, deals with all sorts of lipids. Removes toxins from the cell, augmenting till its neutralized. Sequesters ions, keeping them out of the cytoplasm, stored for usage.
** Golgi Apparatus
Protein modification, trafficking. The protein stays in the same compartment the entire time, the machine (organell) moves around it. Secretaory proteins are pushed outside the cell. Vesicle proteins
They can also turn into their own organell, something like a digestive enzyme.
The side that faces the ER serves as the site of entry, the other side faces the plasma membrane where products are transfered. While in the sac the molecules is modified, packged, and its container is removed. May create lysosomes, secretory vecisles, or other functions.
** Endosomes
Membrane-bound vesicular and tublar structures that lie between the plasma membrane and the golgi apparatus.
Certain types of vesicles that pinch off the plasma membrane travel to andfuse with endosomes.
Can pinch off vesicles then move to other cell organells or returns to the plasma membrane.
Endosomes are invol
